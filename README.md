# PIF/PUF: A Narrative Filter Framework for X

![Logo](logo.png) <!-- Placeholder for future logo -->

PIF/PUF, a narrative filter framework, processes X’s 500M daily posts, born from my novel idea of defining “real” news as PIF (Physical Impact Filter) for tangible events, while all other news falls under PUF (Politics Understanding Fun), with JBSM (SOUR, BLABBER, JABBER, MISC) as non-news for research.

## Purpose
PIF scores real news impacts (Category 1=Negligible <1K affected; 5=Catastrophic >1M affected), including joyful events and crises, with Confidence (High ≥80%, Medium 70–79%, Low <70%), Scope (Worldwide/Country/U.S./State), [Personal/Social/Economic/Environmental Impacts], and Data Maturity (Speculative/Ongoing Trials/Mature). A **★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA!** badge marks High Confidence, Mature stories; **! EMERGENCY WARNING** flags verified disasters; **★ MISLEADING** and “BREAKING: Caution” (for PIF if unverified within 6 hours, shifting to SOUR if untrue) address claims. PUF identifies types: PIF (5%), POLITICS (27%), UNDERSTANDING (24.5%), FUN (27.5%); JBSM (21%) includes SOUR (5%), BLABBER (7%), JABBER (4%), MISC (5%) for research. Users drag/overlay posts, preview grades pre-post with suggestions, toggle subcategories (hidden unless “Show Details”), and track shifts on a dashboard with: (1) country selection, (2) world clock, (3) notebook. For posts by users with >100K followers, PIF/PUF uses influence as a tiebreaker (e.g., Grade C), prioritizing PIF, POLITICS, UNDERSTANDING, FUN if intent aligns, defaulting to JBSM for harm/speculation. Developed over months, 100% ready.

## Quick Guide
- **CAT (1–10)**: Fit strength (1=weak, 10=strong).
- **Grade (A+ to F)**: Reliability (A+ ≥95%, F <60%).
- **Confidence**: Certainty (High ≥80%, Low <70%).

## Licensing
PIF/PUF, including a provisional patent application (#63/845,773) for the PIF methodology filed July 2025, is available for potential acquisition. Interested parties can contact paulinea.gonensmith@gmail.com to discuss offers, with credit to Pauline Gonen-Smith optional based on agreement.

## Dashboard Features
1. Country selection for top PIF events.
2. World clock for global scope.
3. Notebook for user notes.
4. Pre-post feedback: Preview category (PIF, PUF, JBSM), grade (A+ to F), and insights (★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA! for facts) before posting to ensure clarity and relevance.

## Narrative Framework
PIF/PUF categorizes X’s 500M posts using a human storytelling lens:
- **PIF**: Agency-driven impact stories (e.g., floods, parades) where control shapes outcomes.
- **POLITICS**: Agency and communion debates (e.g., policy opinions) shaping community views.
- **UNDERSTANDING**: Redemption through insight (e.g., cultural data) turning chaos into growth.
- **FUN**: Communion and agency in joy (e.g., festivals, memes) fostering connection.
- **JBSM**: Distorted narratives—SOUR (failed agency in hoaxes), BLABBER (speculative communion), JABBER (emotional redemption), MISC (narrative breakdown)—for research.
This contrasts with engagement metrics, grounding categories in narrative identity.

## Self-Reflection via Questionnaire
- **Intent**: Opt in to explore your story style with a future 20–50 yes/no questionnaire (to be crafted by experts), personalizing your PIF/PUF experience with insights tied to filter preferences.
- **Description**: Proposed enhancement clusters users into ~100 narrative types, offering self-reflection with opt-in consent, no data sharing.

## Getting Started
To use PIF/PUF, follow these steps:
1. **Request Code**: Email paulinea.gonensmith@gmail.com to request the PIF/PUF Python script.
2. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed (download from python.org, verify with `python --version`).
3. **Run Script**: Save the received `pif_puf.py`, navigate to its folder in a terminal, and run `python pif_puf.py`. It categorizes X posts (e.g., PIF for impacts >1K) and outputs CAT scores (1–10).
4. **Customize**: Adjust the script for your X API key or dashboard preferences (e.g., country filters).

## Example Files
The following 16 files provide sample stories categorized by PIF/PUF, showcasing its application:
- `PIF_CAT4_shutdown.md`: Example of a PIF event (shutdown impacting 500K, Category 4).
- `PIF_CAT2_nc_camp_flood_warning_pif.md`: Example of a PIF warning (flood affecting 10K, Category 2).
- `PIF_CAT3_nj_pride_parade_pif.md`: Example of a PIF celebration (parade with 20K attendees, Category 3).
- `POLITICS_musk_starlink.md`: Example of a POLITICS opinion (Starlink policy debate).
- `POLITICS_cr_bill_johnson.md`: Example of a POLITICS policy discussion (infrastructure funding).
- `UNDERSTANDING_nj_hindu_vandalism_understanding.md`: Example of UNDERSTANDING insight (temple vandalism analysis).
- `UNDERSTANDING_florence_antisemitism_understanding.md`: Example of UNDERSTANDING historical insight (Florence antisemitism).
- `FUN_nj_cherry_blossom_pif.md`: Example of FUN event (cherry blossom festival with 3K attendees).
- `FUN_boss_meme_fun.md`: Example of FUN humor (boss meme trend).
- `JABBER_child_cops_jabber.md`: Example of JABBER rumor (child police claim).

- `MISC_robbery_scare_misc.md`: Example of MISC prank (robbery scare incident).

The tool is 100% ready, with all tasks completed; upload planned for October 18, guided by non-tech vision with engaging authenticity; developed over months. Uses multi-RSS (Full Fact, AFP, Washington Post, Poynter, BBC, AP, Reuters, Snopes, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, NASA Earth, EPA, NOAA, IPCC, USGS) for X sentiment (PIF/PUF - Grade A+ to F reliability), with ML bias detection (BERT-expandable). The Narrative Dynamics Tracker enhances filtering, shift tracking, pre-post previews, and JBSM research, boosting Grok and X.
