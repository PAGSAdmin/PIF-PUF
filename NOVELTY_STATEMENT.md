# Novelty Statement for PIF/PUF Framework

PIF/PUF is a groundbreaking narrative filter framework, born in 2014, that redefines news categorization in a way never done before. Unlike traditional models, it splits X’s 500M daily posts into:
- **PIF (Physical Impact Filter, ~5%)**: Tangible events (e.g., hurricanes, parades) with ★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA! badges for evidence-supported impacts.
- **PUF (Politics Understanding Fun, ~74%)**: Narratives (POLITICS 27%, UNDERSTANDING 24.5%, FUN 22.5%) shaped by human storytelling (agency, communion, redemption).
- **JBSM (21%)**: Non-news (JABBER, BLABBER, SOUR, MISC) for research, flagging distortions.

**Why It’s Novel**: This approach was unfeasible until recent data dynamics (post-2014) and AI tools (e.g., BERT-expandable ML) allowed real-time narrative analysis. The ★ AHA! replaces static “truth” with time-bound, maturing evidence, turning news into actionable clarity—a shift xAI’s Grok can amplify as information evolves.

**Patent-Pending**: Filed July 2025 (#63/845,773), PIF/PUF is a fresh lens, not a rehash. Check examples: http://github.com/PAGSAdmin/PIF-PUF.
