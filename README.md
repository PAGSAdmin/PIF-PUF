[Novelty Statement](./NOVELTY_STATEMENT.md)  
*Pre-read this to understand PIF/PUF's groundbreaking approach before diving in!*

Rooted in 40 years of admin expertise, PIF/PUF delivers an innovative framework incorporating best practices from pre-computer and AI eras, restoring them in this new age to establish clarity in social media chaos. It processes X’s 500M daily posts, offering a novel starting point to define “real” news as PIF (Physical Impact Filter) for tangible events, while all other news falls under PUF (Politics Understanding Fun), with JBSM (JABBER, BLABBER, SOUR, MISC) as non-news for research.

## Purpose
PIF/PUF provides an 8-category adaptive narrative filter 
(PIF, PUF, Clarity Guard as JBSM) 
for users to adapt.

PIF scores real news impacts 
(Category 1=Negligible <1K affected; 5=Catastrophic >1M affected, ~5% of posts) 
with Confidence (High ≥80%, Medium 70-79%, Low <70%), 
Scope (Worldwide/Country/U.S./State), 
[Personal/Social/Economic/Environmental Impacts], 
and Data Maturity (Speculative/Ongoing Trials/Mature).

Badges include:
- ! EMERGENCY WARNING for verified disasters (haptic buzz option)
- ★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA! for High Confidence stories
- ★ MISLEADING with “BREAKING: Caution” (unverified within 6 hours, shifts to SOUR if untrue)

PUF covers other news: 
POLITICS (27%), UNDERSTANDING (24.5%), FUN (22.5%) 
totaling 74%, 
sparking Aha! moments with dynamic insights.

Clarity Guard as JBSM filters noise 
(covering BLABBER 7%, JABBER 4%, SOUR 5%, MISC 5%, totaling 21%) 
to guard clarity and free speech.

*User Features*: 
Drag/overlay posts, preview grades pre-post, 
toggle subcategories, 
track shifts on a dashboard (country selection, world clock, notebook).

*Technical Enhancements*: 
Multi-RSS (Full Fact, AFP, etc.) for X sentiment (Grade A+ to F), 
with ML bias detection (BERT-expandable) and AI for insights.

Designed for xAI’s Grok to enhance X’s global clarity.

## Revenue Opportunities
- **Creator Boost**: PIF spots high-impact posts (e.g., Cat 3 floods with ! EMERGENCY WARNING) for top ad slots, earning creators approximately $200+ in ad revenue or X shares for 100K+ views (2025 X data).
- **Story Paydays**: PUF tags hit content (FUN jokes, UNDERSTANDING tips) with ★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA!, boosting payouts—approximately $500 extra for 50K likes (Taisly 2025). Example: A tech tutorial with 50K likes earned $370 on YouTube equivalent (Epidemic Sound 2025), scalable on X.
- **Lawsuit Shield**: JBSM mutes junk (hoaxes, rants) by default, cutting legal risks—2025 saw 1,200+ U.S. cases costing platforms millions (e.g., X’s $128M executive settlement). PIF/PUF’s audit logs (e.g., high-confidence verification) provide court-ready defense.
- **Community Pulse Pay**: Local impact posts (e.g., neighborhood alerts) earn approximately $100-300 “Pulse Pay” bonuses for verified creators (e.g., $200 for 20K views on a verified alert, per HubSpot 2025).

## Quick Guide
- CAT (1–10): Fit strength (1=weak, 10=strong).
- Grade (A+ to F): Reliability (A+ ≥95%, F <60%).
- Confidence: Certainty (High ≥80%, Low <70%).

## Licensing
PIF/PUF, including a provisional patent application (#63/845,773) filed July 2025, is available for potential acquisition. Interested parties can contact paulinea.gonensmith@gmail.com to discuss offers, with credit to Pauline Gonen-Smith optional based on agreement.

## Dashboard Features
1. Country selection for top PIF events, enhanced by real-time X updates and Trend Alerts for recurring impacts (e.g., flood seasons) across global regions.
2. World clock for international scope, reflecting diverse time zones.
3. Notebook for user notes, auto-populated with web facts from worldwide sources.
4. Pre-post feedback: Preview category, grade, and insights (e.g., ! EMERGENCY WARNING with haptic option or ★ MISLEADING for risky posts) before posting, helping users avoid legal pitfalls (e.g., UK arrests for misinformation) with a global safety net.
5. Community Connect: For Jabber posts, offers a “Support Link” for those seeking supportive connection (e.g., global helplines) and “Authentic Angle” prompts or “Voice Boost” mode for influencers to shift coherent rants to PUF’s UNDERSTANDING, redirecting clutter to meaningful engagement while preserving free speech.
6. User Profiles: Customize PIF/PUF prefs with sliders or checkboxes (e.g., more FUN, less POLITICS), tailoring feeds to personal interests across global cultures.
   
## Community Features
- **Community Pulse Check**: PIF scans X for local chatter (e.g., floods, closures), scoring urgency by tweet volume and confidence. Flags impacts with ! EMERGENCY WARNING; PUF tags related stories (UNDERSTANDING, FUN); JBSM filters noise.

## Narrative Framework
PIF/PUF categorizes X’s 500M posts using a human storytelling lens:
- PIF: Agency-driven impact stories (e.g., floods, parades) where control shapes outcomes.
- POLITICS: Agency and communion debates (e.g., policy opinions) shaping community views.
- UNDERSTANDING: Redemption through insight (e.g., cultural data) turning chaos into growth.
- FUN: Communion and agency in joy (e.g., festivals, memes) fostering connection.
- JBSM: Distorted narratives—SOUR (failed agency in hoaxes), BLABBER (speculative communion), JABBER (emotional redemption), MISC (narrative breakdown)—for research. This contrasts with engagement metrics, grounding categories in narrative identity.

## Truth and Aha! in PIF/PUF
- **PIF Anchors Truth in Impacts**: PIF tracks real-world impacts (like ! EMERGENCY WARNING for floods) using solid data, such as how many people are affected. It’s verified with high confidence (80% or more), serving as a guide for action.
- **PUF and Clarity Guard Bring Aha! Moments**: PUF lights up stories (POLITICS, UNDERSTANDING, FUN) with fresh insights that change with viewpoints. Clarity Guard, a catch-all term for noise categories (JABBER, BLABBER, SOUR, MISC), filters out clutter while protecting free speech, letting perspectives shift without sticking to one truth.
- **Dynamic vs. Static**: This setup embraces lively ideas over fixed claims, keeping X clear and open for all.

## Self-Reflection via Questionnaire
- Intent: Opt in to explore your story style with a future 20–50 yes/no questionnaire (to be crafted by experts), personalizing your PIF/PUF experience with insights tied to filter preferences.
- Description: Proposed enhancement clusters users into ~100 narrative types, offering self-reflection with opt-in consent, no data sharing.

## Getting Started
To use PIF/PUF, follow these steps:
1. Request Code: Email paulinea.gonensmith@gmail.com to request the PIF/PUF Python script.
2. Install Python: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed (download from python.org, verify with `python --version` if comfortable).
3. Run Script: Save the received `pif_puf.py` and use it with provided support to categorize X posts (e.g., PIF for impacts >1K), outputting CAT scores (1–10).
4. Customize: Adjust the script with help for your X API key or dashboard preferences (e.g., country filters).
