# PIF/PUF: A Narrative Filter Framework for X

![Logo](logo.png) <!-- Placeholder for future logo -->

PIF/PUF, a narrative filter framework, processes X’s 500M daily posts, born from my novel idea of defining “real” news as PIF (Physical Impact Filter) for tangible events, while all other news falls under PUF (Politics Understanding Fun), with JBSM (SOUR, BLABBER, JABBER, MISC) as non-news for research.

## Purpose
PIF highlights real impacts (Category 1–5) with Confidence (High ≥80%, Medium 70–79%, Low <70%), Scope, and Impacts, tagged **★ HIGH-IMPACT AHA!** or **! EMERGENCY WARNING**. PUF categorizes: PIF (5%), POLITICS (27%), UNDERSTANDING (24.5%), FUN (27.5%); JBSM (21%) includes SOUR (5%), BLABBER (7%), JABBER (4%), MISC (5%). Users drag/overlay posts, preview grades, and toggle subcategories. The dashboard offers: (1) country selection for top PIF events, (2) world clock, (3) notebook. Developed over months, 100% ready.

## Quick Guide
- **CAT (1–10)**: Fit strength (1=weak, 10=strong).
- **Grade (A+ to F)**: Reliability (A+ ≥95%, F <60%).
- **Confidence**: Certainty (High ≥80%, Low <70%).

## Licensing
PIF/PUF, including a provisional patent application (#63/845,773) for the PIF methodology filed July 2025, is available for potential acquisition. Interested parties can contact paulinea.gonensmith@gmail.com to discuss offers, with credit to Pauline Gonen-Smith optional based on agreement.

## Dashboard Features
(1) Country selection for PIF, (2) world clock, (3) notebook.

Uses multi-RSS for sentiment, ML (BERT-expandable). Upload October 16.

## Origin Story
On October 29, 2014, I first envisioned PIF, noting: “I’ve been thinking about how many individuals are actually physically affected by media big stories... I would love a standard practice to assign a population impact factor... to gauge how personally relevant the story is.” This idea, inspired by events like Ebola NYC to reduce fear-mongering through tangible impacts (e.g., subway proximity), evolved into PIF/PUF’s framework over months with Grok’s support.

The tool is 100% ready, with all tasks completed; upload planned for October 18, guided by non-tech vision with engaging authenticity; developed over months. Uses multi-RSS (Full Fact, AFP, Washington Post, Poynter, BBC, AP, Reuters, Snopes, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, NASA Earth, EPA, NOAA, IPCC, USGS) for X sentiment (PIF/PUF - Grade A+ to F reliability), with ML bias detection (BERT-expandable). The Narrative Dynamics Tracker enhances filtering, shift tracking, pre-post previews, and JBSM research, boosting Grok and X.
